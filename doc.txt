Welcome to the Prime Number Math Program!

Introduction:
In this project, you will write a program that performs basic math operations using prime numbers. Your program should have functions for determining whether a given number is prime, finding the nth prime number, and performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using prime numbers.

Requirements:
- You must use Java, C++, or Python for your implementation.
- Your program must have functions for the following operations:
    - Determining whether a given number is prime.
    - Finding the nth prime number.
    - Adding two prime numbers.
    - Subtracting two prime numbers.
    - Multiplying two prime numbers.
    - Dividing two prime numbers.
- The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions should receive the position of the prime number as a parameter. For example, to find 5 X 7, you would enter the parameters 3 and 4 since 5 is the third prime number and 7 is the fourth prime number.
- You should include comments in your code to explain how your functions work and what parameters they expect.
- Your code should be well-organized and easy to read.

Extra Credit
If you complete this assignment in Rust and use the Cargo package manager, you will receive 10 points of extra credit.

Here's a list of the available functions:

isPrime(n)
------------------
Determines whether a given number is prime or not.

Parameters:
n - The number to check for primality.

Returns:
True if the number is prime, false otherwise.


nthPrime(n)
------------------
Finds the nth prime number.

Parameters:
n - The index of the prime number to find.

Returns:
The nth prime number.


add(posA, posB)
------------------
Adds two prime numbers.

Parameters:
posA - The position of the first prime number.
posB - The position of the second prime number.

Returns:
The sum of the two prime numbers.


subtract(posA, posB)
------------------
Subtracts two prime numbers.

Parameters:
posA - The position of the first prime number.
posB - The position of the second prime number.

Returns:
The difference between the two prime numbers.


multiply(posA, posB)
------------------
Multiplies two prime numbers.

Parameters:
posA - The position of the first prime number.
posB - The position of the second prime number.

Returns:
The product of the two prime numbers.


divide(posA, posB)
------------------
Divides two prime numbers.

Parameters:
posA - The position of the first prime number.
posB - The position of the second prime number.

Returns:
The result of dividing the first prime number by the second.

Throws:
ArithmeticException - If posB is 0 (division by zero).
